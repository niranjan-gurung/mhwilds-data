## MH Wilds Data Generate (WIP)

A simple and dirty web scraper that grabs game data such as: armours, weapons, skills, set bonuses etc. (currently only armour skills implemented). This is used by the mhwilds-api project for storing the data. Scraping process contains delay to limit actions/requests on the source and is done only once initially to seed the database.

Website used as the data source: https://mhwilds.kiranico.com/

TODO:
- set bonus
- group skills
- weapon data
- food skills
